# Create: Cold Sweat

CCS is a bridge mod for Cold Sweat and Create to add more specific features that a datapack or kubeJS settings can't fully grasp, including features such as:

*   Fluid temperatures
*   Special temperature formulas for create
*   Special interactions for create objects

CCS is designed to allow modpack devs or common players to configure it as pleased, boilers can be giant dangerous setups or just nice seat warmers, ever wanted heated floors in minecraft? You can now adjust the game to use pipes as floor warmers, have fun!

If you need help with configuring the mod feel free to read [the docs](https://github.com/banana-boye/CCS/wiki) and/or [join the discord server](https://discord.com/invite/g7ayQhPDhE)
